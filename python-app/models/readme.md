In order for the upscaler to work, a pre-trained model is needed.

This app was built using RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth, which you can get here:
https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN

CTRL+F for "RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth" on the page and you'll see a download link.

Once you have the model, just place the .pth file in this directory right next to `readme.md`.

Note that using a different model will require tweaks in the application's code.
